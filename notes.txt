In angular, the single page that is served is the index.html file in the root directory. The rest code is passed as
bundle.js.

The first JavaScript/TypeScript code that gets executed is the one in the main.ts file.
    - Then we bootstrap an angular application and we pass this module as an argument.
    - In this module, we tell angular that there is an AppComponent, that you should know of while starting the application.
    - Then angular reads the component setup and thereof knows the selector.

A component, in Angular is just a TypeScript class. Angular is able to instantiate it, to create objects.

Decorators are a typescript feature that allows you to enhance your classes/elements. for eg @Component
@Component({
  //meta data  
})

Inside the braces we add meta-data which teels angular what to do with this class.

Angular uses component to create webpages and uses modules to bundle different components into packages. (eg app.module.ts).
We register new component in the declaration array in module files

Data Binding - Communication between your typescript code and Template.
Output data - String interpolation ( {{ data }} ) or Property Binding ( [ property ] = "data" )
React to User - Event Binding ( ( event ) = "expression" )

Combination of both = 2 way data binding ( [( ngModel )] = "data" ) - where we are able to react to events and output Data
at the same time.

[] - implies angular that we are binding some property.
String interpolation does not work in property binding.

$event - It is simply the data that will be emitted with that event. Reserved word

Two Way Databinding - With two way data binding we combine both Property and event binding.

Directives : Directives are instructions in the DOM.
