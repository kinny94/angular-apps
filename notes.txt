In angular, the single page that is served is the index.html file in the root directory. The rest code is passed as
bundle.js.

The first JavaScript/TypeScript code that gets executed is the one in the main.ts file.
    - Then we bootstrap an angular application and we pass this module as an argument.
    - In this module, we tell angular that there is an AppComponent, that you should know of while starting the application.
    - Then angular reads the component setup and thereof knows the selector.

A component, in Angular is just a TypeScript class. Angular is able to instantiate it, to create objects.

Decorators are a typescript feature that allows you to enhance your classes/elements. for eg @Component
@Component({
  //meta data  
})

Inside the braces we add meta-data which teels angular what to do with this class.
